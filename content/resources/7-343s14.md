description: In this micrograph of neurons grown in culture, the tan threads are nerve
  cells, and the round tan beads are synapses, the connections that form between nerve
  cells. Changes in these connections are believed to underlie learning and memory

  image-alt: Nerve cells grown in culture as seen under a microscope. Nerve cells
    appear as tan threads on a brown background. Round tan beads on these threads
    are the synapses, the connections between nerve cells.
