## Course Overview

This page focuses on the course _7.343 Biological Bases of Learning and Memory_ as it was taught by Postdoctoral Associate Lauren Makuch and Research Scientist Jai Subramanian in Spring 2014.

This course is one of many [Advanced Undergraduate Seminars](https://biology.mit.edu/undergraduate/current-students/subject-offerings/advanced-undergraduate-seminars/) offered by the Biology Department at MIT. In these pass/fail seminars, students draw upon primary research literature to discuss and learn about current biological research in a highly interactive, small-group setting. This particular seminar focuses on the biological basis of learning and memory.
